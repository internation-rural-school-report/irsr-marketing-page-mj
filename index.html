<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>International Rural School Report is a centralized, online management system for school facilities designed with rural schools in mind.</p>
<div class="content-box-container">
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>Reports</h3>
        <p>International Rural School Report gives users the ability to report issues and organize them by date.</p>
        <div class="issues">
        <div class="issue-text">
            <h3>Issue Categories</h3>

        <h3>How to Report</h3>
        <p>Users with school administrator level access can make a report with the date, the issue category, and any relevant information or images. The app keeps track of who makes which reports and updates in real time.</p>
    </div>
    <img class="content-img" src="img/meeting-admins.jpg" alt="admins having a meeting">
    <div class="content-box">
        <h3>View Formats</h3>
        <p>You can view issues in summary or as single issues with more detailed information. The status report function allows you to keep track of what has been resolved, what is in progress, and what needs to be done. Users with board member level access can update the status of issues and mark things as resolved, ignored, or pending for peace of mind.</p>
        <p>There is also the option to review and update resolved issues, including the original issue report, who resolved it, and how it was resolved. This gives schools the ability to keep track of past actions and record maintenance and inventory management in real time across multiple devices.</p>

It sometimes took days to get in touch with board members due to where our school is located. When things broke, it became difficult to teach. Now, we can stay in communication about what we need at our schools easily, all in one place. And I can use it on my mobile!"

                <p>"Our school got a big grant from an NGO to start using state of the art technology while teaching. When our roof leaked last year, it ruined some of our expensive, irreplacable equipment. While International Rural School Report can't protect items from environmental damage, it would have saved a lot of headache in keeping track of the repairs. I consider this product a must-have for any school which needs to connect with multiple entities about the state of facilities and equipment. It's a school saver."</p>
