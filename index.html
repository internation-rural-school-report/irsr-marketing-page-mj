<div class="content-box">
<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>With International Rural School Report, you can streamline the way your school manages facilities, equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>Because everything is online and easily accessible to school administrators and board members, schools can stay in communication and organized about maintenance issues and supply needs.</p>

<div class="content-box-container">
    <div class="content-box">
<h3>School Administrators</h3>
<p> School administrators can create, read, update and delete reports on conditions in the school, including facility maintenance issues, repair needs, and supply requirements.

              <p>"I'm in charge of managing all my school's equipment as head teacher. Before International Rural School Report, we were using an old notebook to keep track of things. It sometimes took days to get in touch with board members due to where our school is located. When things broke, it became difficult to teach. Now, we can stay in communication about what we need at our schools easily, all in one place. And I can use it on my mobile!"

                <p>"Our school got a big grant from an NGO to start using state of the art technology while teaching. When our roof leaked last year, it ruined some of our expensive, irreplacable equipment. While International Rural School Report can't protect items from environmental damage, it would have saved a lot of headache in keeping track of the repairs. I consider this product a must-have for any school which needs to connect with multiple entities about the state of facilities and equipment. It's a school saver."</p>
